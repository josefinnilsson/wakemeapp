# Wake Me App

## About
Wake Me App is an application that shows you the information you need in the morning: your events for the day, the current weather, the status of your favourite SL station and the latest news.

### Try It Out
Go to [wakemeapp.herokuapp.com](https://wakemeapp.herokuapp.com) and start by creating a user (your password is stored hashed and salted). Then do some setup by visiting the settings page and configuring your desired SL station and authenticate your Google Calendar by clicking the 'refresh calendar' button in the calendar component. Now you will be able to see your personal information (if you can't, just click the refresh buttons).

## Mid Project Review
The first half of the project we have focused on the backend part of the project gathering and parsing data from the various APIs we are using. Hence there still is a lot of work to be done design wise.

### What We Have Done
- Created user creation and authentication functionality connected to a MongoDB database.
- Created a calendar component that uses OAuth to authorize usage of the users Google Calendar and then shows the users' calendar events.
- Created a SL component that shows the next departures on a station chosen by the user. The stations and types of transportation can be configured on the settings page.
- Created a weather component that, if the user have allowed the application to know current location, shows the weather were the user is located right now.
- Created a news component that shows the latest news from Svenska Dagbladet.
- Created a functionality that allows the user to switch between three different themes: minimalistic, NASA and Unsplash.
- Created static components such as header and footer.
- Created a drag-and-drop functionality to the compoenents.
- Created error- and information messages to the user interface.
- Styled the whole application.
- Styled mobile view.

## Project structure
This repository holds both the frontend and backend for Wake Me App. The application consists of a React frontend which can be found in the `/client` directory and a express backend which can be found in the `/api` directory.

## Running Locally
First, [install Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). Then standing in the root directory run:
* `npm install` to install the frontend and backend dependencies.
* `npm run start-dev` to start the server and client. The application can be visited at [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) and the server at [localhost:3001](https://localhost:3001).\\

*Note: Running the application locally requires you to have the correct environmental variables set up.*
